# SKKU-뭐먹지

Almost all SKKU students have daily trouble. The trouble is what to eat for lunch or dinner. This kind of trouble comes from the lack of the number of restaurants and individuals' ignorant of the restaurant’s existence. So, we try to solve this problem.
We will make a website that introduces restaurant’s locations and categorize them. This website will provide a search function and recommend one restaurant randomly function
